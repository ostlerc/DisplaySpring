Optional Setup\r\n  c. Creating a Menu\r\n\r\n  a. Required Setup\r\n  -----------------\r\n\r\n    1. call Menu.LoadContent(GraphicsDevice, Font) (In LoadContent)\r\n        ex. Menu.LoadContent(GraphicsDevice, MyFont);\r\n\r\n    2. In LoadContent() Instantiate your menu\r\n        ex. MyMenu newMenu = new MyMenu(...);\r\n\r\n    3. In the Update() function, add yourMenu.Update()\r\n        ex. newMenu.Update(gameTime);\r\n\r\n    4. In the Draw() function, add yourMenu.Draw()\r\n        ex. newMenu.Draw(gameTime, spriteBatch);\r\n\r\n  b. Optional Setup\r\n  -----------------\r\n\r\n    Also in the LoadContent (wherever you want really,\r\n    but load content is a good place to override these)\r\n\r\n    Menu.DefaultCloseSound\r\n    Item.DefaultCancelSound\r\n    Item.DefaultFocusSound\r\n    Item.DefaultSelectSound\r\n\r\n    NOTE: a null value means no sound will play\r\n\r\n  c. Creating a Menu\r\n  -----------------\r\n\r\n    1. Create a new class and inherit from DisplaySpring.Menu\r\n    2. In your constructor create and add Items to BaseFrame\r\n    3. Override functions such as Draw, Update, Reset for \r\n       more customization\r\n\r\nII - Installation\r\n---------------------\r\n  1. Add DisplaySpring.dll as a reference\r\n     -  Do this by right click on your project, and add reference\r\n\r\n    Note: you will also want to copy the DisplaySpring.XML with your .dll\t\r\n          This is so you get the documentation with the library\r\n\r\n  2. That's it!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII - Examples\r\n---------------------\r\n  For examples reference the example project 'Display Spring Demo'\r\n  Also you can go to www.displayspring.com\r\n\r\nIV. - Help\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n  For help you can go online to displayspring.com \r\n  and see if anyone else has had the same\r\n  problems as you.\r\n\r\n  Or, you can email me!\r\n  ostler.c@gmail.com\r\n\r\n  Please explain in detail your problem.
