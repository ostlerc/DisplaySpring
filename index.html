<h2>I - Getting started</h2>

<p>a. Required setup
  b. Optional Setup
  c. Creating a Menu</p>

<p>a. Required Setup</p>

<hr><pre><code>1. call Menu.LoadContent(GraphicsDevice, Font) (In LoadContent)
    ex. Menu.LoadContent(GraphicsDevice, MyFont);

2. In LoadContent() Instantiate your menu
    ex. MyMenu newMenu = new MyMenu(...);

3. In the Update() function, add yourMenu.Update()
    ex. newMenu.Update(gameTime);

4. In the Draw() function, add yourMenu.Draw()
    ex. newMenu.Draw(gameTime, spriteBatch);
</code></pre>

<p>b. Optional Setup</p>

<hr><pre><code>Also in the LoadContent (wherever you want really,
but load content is a good place to override these)

Menu.DefaultCloseSound
Item.DefaultCancelSound
Item.DefaultFocusSound
Item.DefaultSelectSound

NOTE: a null value means no sound will play
</code></pre>

<p>c. Creating a Menu</p>

<hr><pre><code>1. Create a new class and inherit from DisplaySpring.Menu
2. In your constructor create and add Items to BaseFrame
3. Override functions such as Draw, Update, Reset for 
   more customization
</code></pre>
